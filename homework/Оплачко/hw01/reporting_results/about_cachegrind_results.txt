Interacting with a machine's cache hierarchy was simulated by a valgrind's tool "cachegrind". The simulated machine has independent first-level instruction and data caches (I1 and D1), backed by a L2 cache. In this case we're interested in D1 cache read misrate value (hereinafter D1mr). As we see in the reporting file "cachegrind_info.txt", in the case of rows-summation D1mr accounts for 3.1%, yet in the case of columns-summation it's 50.0%. Thus, when we sum matrix elements by columns, D1 cache read miss occurs on average every second query, so existence of the cache increased the performance of the summation procedure only about twice. In conclusion, proper handling of caches sometimes gives increasing by a few orders.
